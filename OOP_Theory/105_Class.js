Class
01) Class is an factory to create multiple object without code duplication
02) Class makes Object more shorter, clean and easily customize or updatable
03) Class is a main frame of an object, Like
    01) If a institute has 500 students and all they have to complete their admission
    02) Now we have to create a public form for collect their data
    03) Making 500 copys of that form
    04) All they complete admission and fullfilled their data.
    Here,
        01) No 2, that means the empty public form is a class
        02) No 4, that means the every colleted data form is an object
