Think Everthing as an Object

01) Yes, OOP thinks everything as an object.
02) A Man has many staticstics for know about him/her. Like,
    01) Name
    02) Education Status
    03) Body
    04) Gender etc.
    So which makes us to easy for know or reconize anything, that every properties is an object

03) If any property has multiples values that property is an object. Like,
    01) Man
    02) Car
    03) Laptop
    04) Fridge
    05) Cycle
    06) Book
    07) Chair
    08) Shoes
    09) Fan
    10) Router

04) Generally a Number is not an Object. But it can also be an object
    01) If we assign 45 in a variable and add (.000). Result will be 45.000
    02) Now 45.000 has multiple values to think it as an object. Like, Is'it ?
        01) String
        02) Float
        03) Integer
        04) Positive
        05) Negative
