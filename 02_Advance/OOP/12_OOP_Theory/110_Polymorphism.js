/*

Polymorphism
01) Polymorphism means same carateristics but it intreduce itself in a new way in every time.
02) Like a method of print area. Now we can used the print method in different type of object like,
    01) Circle
    02) Rectangle
    03) Square
    04) Polygon
    We provide different data as they need but we print in same method and we get different result or carateristics of same method. That is Polymorphism.
