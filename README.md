## JavaScript All To Know
JavaScript is the most popular Programming language in the world. Over [97%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-deployedstats-12) of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. 

## Why JavaScript?
Why not? All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. It can be used in Front-end, Back-end, Android, IOS, Desktop & AI also.  So I decided to learn & practice **JavaScript That All Need To Know**.
